# Three.js Journey Course Exercises

This repository contains the exercises for the [Three.js Journey Course](https://threejs-journey.com/).

Great appreciation to Bruno Simon for the wonderful course.

## Features

- Type safety with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

- Uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for development and bundling.

- Uses `yarn workspace` to reduce redundant dependencies like `three` and `gsap`.

- Quality tools like [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) are configured. Check [@umijs/fabric](https://github.com/umijs/fabric/) for rules.
